This repository contains a simple C program that illustrates a potential pitfall when working with pointers. The program demonstrates how modifying a variable indirectly using a pointer changes the value.  Understanding pointer arithmetic and memory management is crucial for writing correct and robust C code. Solutions to handle or avoid this issue might involve more careful use of pointers or using alternative memory management techniques.
